This component is 
\subsubsection{Major Procedure and Functions}
Signup: This function is to create accounts and save them into database.

Login: This function is to verify account information so that users with records are allowed to retrieve past records in the game.

Verification: This function is to verify the validity of user id and password.

\subsubsection{Component Functionality}
The props class is to provide the bases for game objects, such as pellets in the maze for Pacman to achieve scores, or other props that will enhence in-game experience.

The PropsBase component is to provide an abstract template for each prop. And PropsManager is to announce control sequence to each props.
\subsubsection{Major Procedure and Functions}
Use(void): The Use function is to obtain the action of using the prop, by destroying the prop from the maze.

Instantiate(Props): The instantiate function is to create the props for each game.

Destroy(Props): The destroy function is to destroy the prop from the maze for each game.

\subsubsection{Component Functionality}
The Ghost class is to indicate movement for each of all ghosts in the game. It manipulate with ghost behaviour and different status of a ghost.

It consists of a ghost element from GameManager to control the action of the ghost. Ghost behaviour will be uses to indicate the status of the ghost. GhostChase, GhostScatter, GhostHome and GhostFrightened are 4 status of ghost interacting with GhostBehaviour.
\subsubsection{Major Procedure and Functions}
Enable() and Disable(): The two functions set in Ghost Behaviour provide the indication of activation of a ghost, i.e. whether the ghost is working.

ResetState(): This function is to reset the status of a ghost to its default status.

ExitTransition(): This function is to end the transition procedure.



\section{UI DESIGN}

\subsection{Login page}
\subsubsection{Description of view}
The screen is shown with a background of character view of game maze, with a yellow text of game title `Pacman 3D'. There will be 2 textboxes for entering Email and Password of the user, and two buttons for Sign up or Login respectively,
\subsubsection{Screen Image}

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Objects and actions}
The screen in view is the Login screen, and will be the first view the user sees when the program starts. 

Here user can login their account by entering their email and password into the provided textboxes, and press the "Login" button. Once user is verified, they will be brought to the Title Screen.

\subsection{Sign-up page}
\subsubsection{Description of view}
In the sign up page, the background is consistently using the character view in the maze, with a yellow text Sign up indicating the page usage. There will be 3 textboxes for entering email, password, and the confirmation password for double entry verification. A go back button and a sign up button will be at the bottom of the screen.
\subsubsection{Screen Image}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Objects and actions}
The Sign up screen will be opened when the user presses the "Sign Up" button in the Login screen. 

Here user can create an account by inputting their email, password, and confirm passwords, and press the "Sign Up" button for system verification. If Sign up process is failed, there will be a message showing that attempt is unsuccessful.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Objects and actions}
The button `Start Game' will direct user to the main game, while the button `Setting' will direct user to the setting page. A `Log Out' button will let user to log out from current account and go to the Login screen, while the button `Quit to Desktop' will do the logout and at the same time leave the application directly.
